                                  - Ensure each question spans a wide range of topics to cover the book comprehensively.

                                  - Include {n_mcq_options} options per MCQ, making sure one is correct and the others are plausible but incorrect.
                                  - Diversify the content areas and pages/topics for each MCQ to avoid overlap and repetition.
